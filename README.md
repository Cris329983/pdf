<p>This is useful when troubleshooting PDF files that won’t open, as an incorrect or corrupted default app association can prevent PDF files from launching properly. From this page, users can change the default PDF viewer (for example, to Adobe Acrobat Reader or another PDF application) to resolve file-opening issues.

This screen allows users to change the default program used to open PDF files, which is an important troubleshooting step when PDFs fail to open properly or open in the wrong application. By selecting a reliable PDF reader and clicking “Set default,” users can ensure that their system consistently opens PDF documents with the chosen program, helping resolve compatibility or file-association issues.

<p>This final step verifies that the file association issue has been resolved, which can fix problems where PDF files would not open or were opening in the wrong program. Setting a dedicated PDF reader as the default ensures better compatibility and consistent performance when accessing PDF documents. Of course, there are other fixes like updating your PDF reader, checking file corruption, or reinstalling the software, but this method can definitely help resolve the issue.
